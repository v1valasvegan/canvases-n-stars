# canvases-n-stars

Create 2 canvases 600x600 px and 600x50 px, draw 5 painted 5 end stars in the larger one. Red, blue, green, yellow and black colors. When you click on the colored star, fill the small canvas with the corresponding color. If you click on a white (not colored) area of a large canvas, the small canvas will be colored with white.
